# MS Teams Remote Control

### Overview


USB widget that allows for more control of MS teams.  Here are some features I that I want to add:

1. Mouse mimic~er where the device mimics mouse jiggles to prevent the away status icon from appearing.
2. Control over video - can turn on and turn off
3. Control over mute button
4. Answer/hang up on call
5. Shut down application (ALT + F4)
