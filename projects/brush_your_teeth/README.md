# Proximity Controlled NeoPixel Ring

This code controls a SparkFun APDS-9960 proximity sensor and an Adafruit NeoPixel ring. The proximity sensor is set up to detect proximity levels and trigger an interrupt when the proximity level is too high or too low. When the interrupt is triggered, it reads the proximity level and turns on all the pixels in the NeoPixel ring to blue. Then, it turns off one pixel at a time in a clockwise direction until all the pixels are off. After that, the NeoPixel ring flashes green five times before turning off all the pixels.

The function `colorWipe()` fills the pixels with a specified color, and the function `interruptRoutine()` updates a flag when an interrupt occurs.

## Code Structure

1. Include required libraries.
2. Define pins, constants, and initialize variables.
3. Set up the hardware in the `setup()` function.
4. Implement the main loop in the `loop()` function.
5. Create additional helper functions like `colorWipe()` and `interruptRoutine()`.

### Special Considerations

- Make sure to have the correct libraries installed for the SparkFun APDS-9960 proximity sensor and Adafruit NeoPixel ring.
- Adjust the proximity sensor gain and interrupt thresholds according to the specific use case and requirements.

```cpp
#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>
#include <Wire.h>
#include <SparkFun_APDS9960.h>

#define APDS9960_INT 2
#define LED_PIN 13     
#define PIXEL_PIN 6
#define NUM_PIXELS 16

#define PROX_INT_HIGH 150
#define PROX_INT_LOW 0
const int BRUSH_TIME = 30000;
int delay_time = (BRUSH_TIME / NUM_PIXELS) * 4; 

SparkFun_APDS9960 apds = SparkFun_APDS9960();
uint8_t proximity_data = 0;
int isr_flag = 0;
Adafruit_NeoPixel pixels = Adafruit_NeoPixel(NUM_PIXELS, PIXEL_PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);

void setup() {
  // ...
}

void loop() {
  // ...
}

void colorWipe(uint32_t c, uint8_t wait) {
  // ...
}

void interruptRoutine() {
  isr_flag = 1;
}

```

```

Proximity Controlled NeoPixel Ring: An Interactive LED Display

In this blog post, we will walk you through a fun and interactive project using a SparkFun APDS-9960 proximity sensor and an Adafruit NeoPixel ring. This project detects proximity levels and triggers an interrupt when the proximity level is too high or too low. When the interrupt is triggered, it reads the proximity level and turns on all the pixels in the NeoPixel ring to blue. Then, it turns off one pixel at a time in a clockwise direction until all the pixels are off. After that, the NeoPixel ring flashes green five times before turning off all the pixels.

Getting Started

To begin this project, you'll need the following components:

1. A SparkFun APDS-9960 Proximity Sensor
2. An Adafruit NeoPixel Ring (16 LEDs)
3. An Arduino-compatible microcontroller
4. Jumper wires and a breadboard

Additionally, you'll need to install the required libraries for the SparkFun APDS-9960 proximity sensor and Adafruit NeoPixel ring in your Arduino IDE:

1. SparkFun_APDS9960
2. Adafruit_NeoPixel

Code Structure

The code for this project consists of several parts:

1. Including the required libraries
2. Defining pins, constants, and initializing variables
3. Setting up the hardware in the setup() function
4. Implementing the main loop in the loop() function
5. Creating additional helper functions like colorWipe() and interruptRoutine()

Including the Required Libraries

Start by including the necessary libraries at the beginning of your sketch:

```cpp
#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>
#include <Wire.h>
#include <SparkFun_APDS9960.h>

```

Defining Pins, Constants, and Initializing Variables

Define the pins, constants, and initialize the variables required for this project:

```cpp
#define APDS9960_INT 2
#define LED_PIN 13     
#define PIXEL_PIN 6
#define NUM_PIXELS 16

#define PROX_INT_HIGH 150
#define PROX_INT_LOW 0
const int BRUSH_TIME = 30000;
int delay_time = (BRUSH_TIME / NUM_PIXELS) * 4; 

SparkFun_APDS9960 apds = SparkFun_APDS9960();
uint8_t proximity_data = 0;
int isr_flag = 0;
Adafruit_NeoPixel pixels = Adafruit_NeoPixel(NUM_PIXELS, PIXEL_PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);

```

Setting Up the Hardware

In the `setup()` function, configure the pins, initialize the serial communication, set up the interrupt, and initialize the proximity sensor and NeoPixel ring:

```cpp
void setup() {
  // ...
}

```

Implementing the Main Loop

In the `loop()` function, check for interrupts, read the proximity level, update the NeoPixel ring display, and clear the interrupt:

```cpp
void loop() {
  // ...
}

```

Helper Functions

Create helper functions, such as `colorWipe()` to fill the pixels with a specified color and `interruptRoutine()` to update a flag when an interrupt occurs:

```cpp
void colorWipe(uint32_t c, uint8_t wait) {
  // ...
}

void interruptRoutine() {
  isr_flag = 1;
}

```

Special Considerations

- Adjust the proximity sensor gain and interrupt thresholds according to the specific use case and requirements.
- Ensure that the
